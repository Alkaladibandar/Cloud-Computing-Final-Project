<h1>Cloud Governance (process and issues) </h1>

<h2> •	What is Cloud Governance? </h2>
-	Cloud governance is a set of rules created by a business entity and used to monitor costs, prevent security issues and improve efficiency of the business.
-	Cloud Governance is the people, process, and  technology associated with the cloud infrastructure, security, and operations. 
-	Cloud governance implementation.
-	Cloud governance is a carefully designed set of rules and protocols put in place by businesses that operate in a cloud environment to enhance data security, manage risks, and keep things running smoothly.

<h2>•	Explain Cloud Governance in terms of policy and security frameworks.</h2>
<h2>-	Policies framework :</h2>
1-	The infrastructure, or virtualization platform.
2-	The operating system.
3-	The platform or application.
4-	The business/user activity on that platform.

-	Governance policies contain a set of protocols of how things should be regulated on the cloud.

-	Which considers four operations levels :
1-	Application deployment and lifecycle
2-	Security and privacy
3-	Management and monitoring
4-	Operations and support

-	Cloud security governance supports business objectives by defining policies and managing risks through the establishment and maintenance of a framework that supports management structure and processes to provide assurance that information security strategies are consistent with how an organization operates.
-	Security governance is the means by which you control and direct the organization's approach to security.

<h2>•	Benefits of cloud governance. </h2>
The benefits of cloud governance benefit an entity as well.
-	Access Control.
-	Enhanced compliance readiness.
-	Lowered costs.
-	Use a variety of software applications.
-	With the click of a button, you can launch assets.
-	You only pay for what you use.
-	Cloud activity can be monitored and violations dealt with using policy and security.
-	Reduced security risks.

<h2>•	Processes of cloud governance.</h2>

Processes of cloud governance provide an overarching framework for governing the life cycle of the cloud.

•	Processes :
1-	Communication :
-	Methods – Provides information about methods to the governed process .
-	Repository – It’s important for participants in governed processes .
-	Standards – Identifies principles, standards and guidelines which are important to governed processes.
-	Processes specific inputs and outputs – Identifies correct communication mechanism, tools and procedures. 

2-	 Compliance: 
-	Review – A governed process requests that the compliance process perform a specific compliance checkpoint review.
-	Approve – the compliance process communicates with the governed process to obtain approval for compliance.
-	Reject - The compliance process informs the governed process that its findings are not in accordance with policies.

3-	Dispensation :
-	Consider exception – A governed process requests that the dispensation process consider allowing an exception to a process.
-	Exception granted – the dispensation process communicates its decision to grant a compliance exception request.
-	Exception rejected – the dispensation process communicates its decision to reject a request for a compliance exception.

<h2>•	Issues of cloud governance.</h2>
The usage, involvement, and risk around governance differ from entity to entity. 
<h2>Risks:</2>
-	Security – integrity and confidentiality of data
-	Audit and Compliance – issues around data jurisdiction maintaining audit trails and data access control
-	Contract – not fully reading and understand the contract
-	Billing – seeing to it that customers are billed correctly for the resources used
-	Information – the protection of intellectual property.
-	Performance and availability – the availability and performance levels required by an entity to operate.
-	Interoperability – the development of a service that may include other services.

<h2>•	Models in cloud computing.</h2>
Governance models and standards should follow a certain criterion which is : 
-	Driven by business governance while attending IT governance.
-	Follow existing governance models and standards.
-	Should be global and specific to any geography.
-	Shouldn’t be specific to one industry domain.

<h2>•	Governance standards :</h2>

-	COSO – a framework that contains internal controls
-	developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations.
-	COBIT 5 – a governance framework for enterprise IT that complements the COSO framework for corporate governance.
-	ITIL v3 – contains the best practice and process guidance of governance service strategy and management.
-	Val IT – provides policies and processes for evaluation selection of IT-enabled business investments and benefit realization based on COBIT 4.1 framework.
